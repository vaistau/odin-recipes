THE ODIN PROJECT
Project 1 - Odin Recipes

DESCRIPTION
The objective of this project is to produce a functioning albeit brutalist recipe website utilizing only HTML.

Throughout the project, I was able to practice skills regarding:
- Git work flow using command line
- HTML boilerplates, formatting, linking, adding images, and creating lists
