            <li>Every 30 minutes, turn the cabbage over to salt evenly -- total salting time will be 1.5 hours.</li>
            <li>1.5 hours later, rinse the cabbage in cold water 3 times to clean it throroughly.</li>
            <li>Drain the cabbage and set it aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Making Porridge:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put 3 cups of water and sweet rice flour in a pot. Mix well and bring to a boil. Keep stirring the porridge until bubbles appear -- approximately 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 1/4 cup sugar to the porridge. Stir it and cook for a few more minutes until it becomes translucent.</li>
            <li>Remove the porridge from heat and allow it to cool.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Making Kimchi Paste:</h3>

            <li>Place the cold porridge into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add fish sauce, hot pepper flakes, crushed garlic, minced ginger, and minced onion.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Putting It All Together:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the kimchi paste in a large basin and add all the cabbage. Mix it by hand.</li>
            <p><em>*note: If your basin is not large enough to mix all the ingredients at once, do it bit by bit.</em></p>

            <li>Place the kimchi into an air-tight sealed plastic container or glass jar. You can eat it fresh right after making or wait until it's fermented.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Additional notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You may be wondering how you're supposed to know if the kimchi has fermented or not. To find out, open the lid of the kimchi container 1-2 days after preparation. You may see some bubbles, an increase in liquid, and a sour smell -- this indicates it's already fermenting.</li>
