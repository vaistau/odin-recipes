        <h2 class="boba subheader">Directions</h2>
        
        <h3 class="boba mini">Making the Tea:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Steep the tea bags or leaves with 4 cups of freshly boiled water.</li>
            <li>Allow the tea to sit in the water until it cools completely.</li>
        </ol>
       
        <h3 class="boba mini">Making the Simple Syrup:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the water and sugar to a saucepan and quickly stir everything together.</li>
            <li>Heat the water on medium-high heat and cook until the water boils and the sugar completely dissolves.</li>
            <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and let the simple syrup cool before transferring it to a jar.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3 class="boba mini">Cooking the Tapioca Pearls:</h3>

            <li>Bring about 4 cups of water to boil and add the tapioca pearls.</li>
            <li>Stir the pearls and wait for them to float to the top. Then, cook them for another 5 minutes.</li>
            <p><em>*note: Test a pearl to see if it has reached the desired level of softness. Cook the pearls for another few minutes if they are stiff.</em></p>
            <li>Once cooked, drain the hot water from the pearls and quickly rinse them under water before transferring them to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix the pearls with a few tablespoons of simple syrup.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Strain the tea into a pitcher and divide the  cooked tapioca pearls into 4 large glasses.</li>
            <li>Add a few ice cubes to each glass. Add 1.5 tablespoons of milk and 2.5 tablespoons of simple syrup into each glass. Stir, taste test, and adjust to your liking.</li>
        </ol>
