            <li>2/3 cup <strong>warm</strong> water</li>
            <li>Wooden skewers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="dango mini">For Sweet Soy Glaze:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2/3 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tbsp potato/corn starch</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="dango subheader">Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the skewers in water and begin boiling a large pot of water on low heat.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="dango mini">Making Dango:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine Shiratamako and Joshinko flour in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir in warm water <strong>a little bit at a time</strong> while mixing with chopsticks.</li>
            <p><em>*note: It is possible that you may need less or more water depending on your ambient humidity levels.</em></p>
            <li>The flours start to stick together and eventually form clumps. Using your hands, combine them into one ball.</li>
            <li>Knead until the dough becomes smooth. The texture should be like "squeezing an earlobe", as is said in Japan.</li>

            <li>Make the dough into a ball again and divide it into 8 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Then divide each piece into 2 balls to have a total of 16 equal-sized balls weighing about 20 grams.</li>
            <li>Shape the 16 balls into a smooth shape. If the dough is cracking, tap your finger in water and apply the small amount of water on the cracked area to smooth it out.</li>

            <li>Once the water in the pot we set up earlier is boiling, gently drop in each dumpling into the pot. Stir the balls occasionally so they don't stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Dumplings will stay at the bottom first but once they are cooked, they will float. Then cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dumplings into iced water.</li>
            <li>Once the dumplings are cooled, drain the water and transfer them to a tray.</li>
            <li>Skewer three pieces of dango onto a single skewer. Continue with the rest of the dumplings and set aside.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3 class="dango mini">Making Sweet Soy Glaze:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan <strong>without turning on the heat</strong>, as the starch will turn lumpy if you add heat to it before mixing.</li>
            <li>After mixing, turn on the heat and continue to whisk.</li>
            <li>When the sauce becomes thick, remove the saucepan from heat and transfer the sauce to a bowl.</li>

            <li>Pour the sweet soy glaze on top and serve immediately.</li>

        </ol>

        <h2 class="dango subheader">Additional Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To keep the dango tender for longer, adding sugar to the dango will help them stay softer. The recommended amount of sugar is 20% of flour's weight (which is 40 grams). If you reduce the amount, it might not be as effective.</li>
            <li>To store the dango, place the uncooked dumplings in a single layer in an airtight container and freeze them for up to a month. When you use them, boil the frozen dango without defrosting.</li>
